## Project Overview

This project is a simple machine learning deployment demo created while learning how to deploy ML applications.
It demonstrates the difference between Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression by visualizing how each model fits the same dataset.

The main goal of this project is learning deployment workflows, not building a production-level system.

## Concepts Covered

* Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Overfitting vs Underfitting
* Model Evaluation (R² Score)
* Data Visualization using Matplotlib
* Interactive UI using Streamlit
